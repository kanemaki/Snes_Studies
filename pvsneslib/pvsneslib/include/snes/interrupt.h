 *      The NMI flag gets set at begin of Vblank (this happens even if NMIs are disabled). The flag gets reset automatically<br>
 *      at end of Vblank, and gets also reset after reading from this register.<br>
 *      The SNES has only one NMI source (vblank), and the NMI flag is automatically reset (on vblank end), so there's<br>
 *      normally no need to read/acknowledge the flag, except one special case: If one does disable and re-enable NMIs,<br>
 *      then an old NMI may be executed again; acknowledging avoids that effect.<br>
 *      The CPU includes another internal NMI flag, which gets set when "[4200h].7 AND [4210h].7" changes from 0-to-1, and<br>
 *      gets cleared when the NMI gets executed (which should happen around after the next opcode) (if a DMA transfer is<br>
 *      in progress, then it is somewhere after the DMA, in that case the NMI can get executed outside of the Vblank<br>
 *      period, ie. at a time when [4210h].7 is no longer set).<br>
